# Test Automation

Complete the following tasks and share the results with your teacher.

## Project setup

1. Make sure you have npm and node ready and working
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

Should be ready to go!

## Tasks

*Form 01*
Run tests and fix the code so the tests will all pass.

*Form 02*
Add at least 10 more tests. Try to test on the edge of different value ranges. For example `age < 18`

*Form 03*
Tests are missing - add them (following the requirement given in the test file).

*Create a 'Form 04'*
Using previous patterns (or better ones) create a form that that turns gross salary into net salary. You can use [Palgakalkulaator](https://www.kalkulaator.ee/et/palgakalkulaator) to create some tests first and then try to develope your code based on that. Note that you can check/uncheck deductions on the right (helps while writing code).

The calculator should have one input that the user will fill with the gross salary. Clicking the 'Calculate' button should show the user their net salary.
